                What is coffee Palace ?
            </h2>
            <p>A coffee palace was an often large and elaborate residential hotel that did not serve alcohol, most of which were built in Australia in the late 19th century.

                Temperance hotels were first established in the UK in the 1850s to provide an alcohol-free alternative to corner pubs and residential hotels, and by the 1870s they could be found in every town and city, some quite large and elaborate. In the late 1870s the idea caught on in Australia, where the appellation "coffee palace" was almost universal, and dozens were built in the 1880s and early 1890s, including some of the largest hotels in the country. Due to the depression of the mid 1890s, some became ordinary hotels and others were converted to different uses. The name continued to be applied to smaller residential hotels and guest houses in the early 20th century, until the trend died out. As large old hotels that may never have been a financial success, many, including most of the largest, were eventually demolished.</p>

                The Temperance Movement
            </h2>
            <p>Serving coffee is what we do, but creating relationships
                 is why we do it. While we can’t claim to be perfect, 
                 we strive to be the best that we can be in our craft, 
                 all the while establishing an environment where others
                  can also work towards perfecting their own craft.
                   Our cafes serve as a common ground for much of Amarillo, 
                   setting the stage for new ideas and relationships. 
                   We believe that local is better and are committed to
                    the greater community outside our doors, taking large efforts
                     to give back as much as we can.</p>
